This project is a basic key system. That is entirely local no server required. For anonymous script execution allowing for people to gate keep their roblox scripts not only through obfuscation but not even giving the actual url.
So if you were to deobfuscste the script the script would not even lead to a repository but an entire collection.
The best part is the raw link doesn't have to be stored in the script it self.
And the raw link is also not stored in the key.
The script is could be stored in a separate and entirely different repository. 
And the Gatekeeper/Key_Gen can also be configurated to your own digit map
Just make sure to adjust the validator or it's alias as evade injector. 

This project is a utility for keeping our or your scripts safe make sure to obfuscate it tho or someone might steal it. 


(fun fact a typhoon got to our house we had a huge flood and there's a typhoon coming to my town right now apparently there will be a new typhoon on Friday it's Nov 5 2025 rn aka wedsday apparantly there is like 9 more typhoons comin or atleast I hope she was joking our neighbors just flooded BTW I live on a tall house so we didnt get flooded)

The Philipines is so cooked.
Flood control ahh. 

Also the numbers are just Encoded letters and and those numbers + those extra numbers are just encrypted by the digit/emoji map. Making those rubbish looking texts but somehow works.



Also the next project I am working on welp not really working on but more like planning on is using YouTube to simulate torrent.


Plans for future projects.🧑‍💻🤪
Like idk using polyglot files to upload a file with a secret zip file but then I found out. YouTube decoded and reencodes using their own encryption so it basically rewrites the entire file breaking the polyglot when you download it again. So that was impossible. Then I thought what about movies only then I would need to make a project that basically rasters a whole movie seperarate to 3 columns and 3 rows and separate into 10 second clips unfortunately this probly won't work unless I divide this across thousands of accounts and disguise them as shit posting people.
It's a problem because YouTube won't even let me upload 10 videos or shorts across more than 2 accounts.
So if I am planning to upload the example the whole puss in boots movie I would need to upload

(The first Puss in Boots movie (2011) runtime of 90 minutes.
So
 * Total running time in seconds: 5,400
   
 * Number of 10-second clips:540
   
 * Total number of resulting videos: 4,860
   
The result would be 4,860 videos.

Yah that ain't gonna cut it. I might have to give up or just rethink my entire plans
