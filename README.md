This project is a basic key system. That is entirely local no server required. For anonymous script execution allowing for people to gate keep their roblox scripts not only through obfuscation but not even giving the actual url.
So if you were to deobfuscste the script the script would not even lead to a repository but an entire collection.
The best part is the raw link doesn't have to be stored in the script it self.
And the raw link is also not stored in the key.
The script is could be stored in a separate and entirely different repository. 
And the Gatekeeper/Key_Gen can also be configurated to your own digit map
Just make sure to adjust the validator or it's alias as evade injector. 

This project is a utility for keeping our or your scripts safe make sure to obfuscate it tho or someone might steal it.
